# Hero Bridge

This project provides a GUI for automating bridging heroes in DeFi Kingdoms. It allows users to filter heroes by: class, subclass, profession, level, generation, realm, summons, and rarity prior to bridging between realms.

## Installation

You can install the package directly from the releases.

### Source Code

1. To install the package, run:

```bash
pip install https://github.com/dfkburnem/Hero-Bridge/releases/download/v.1.0.0/hero_bridge-1.0.0.tar.gz
```
2. Run script using:

```bash
hero_bridge
```

### Executable

Download the executable from the releases page and run it directly:

1. Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/dfkburnem/Hero-Bridge/releases).
2. Download the executable file (hero_bridge.exe).
3. Run the executable.

## Usage

1. **Select Hero Filters**: Choose the filters for the hero(es) to be bridged.
2. **Enter Password**: Provide the password to decrypt your private key.
3. **Select Heroes for Bridging**: Select the heroes to be bridged from the search area.
4. **Add Additional Heroes**: If desired, search for additional heroes to add to the selected hero(es).
5. **Bridge Heroes**: Bridge selected heroes to the opposing realm.

## Important Notes

- **Reference Files**: Ensure that the `bridge_abi.json` and .key files are located in the same directory from which the script or executable is run.
- **Executable vs Script**: While the executable provides an easier way to run the application, it is not as trustless as running the script directly from the source code. If security and transparency are priorities, consider using the script.
